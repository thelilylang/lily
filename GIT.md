# Git

## Commit

Here's a template of what a commit message looks like:

```
<action>(<topic>): <short description>

[additional content]
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `short description` must be less than 72 characters long.

## Examples

```
style(core/lily): Beautify files.
```

```
refactor(core/lily): Improved formatting of diagnostic reports.
```

### Actions

- build: Changes that affects the building of the code.
- chore: Changes that do not affect the program or the user (.gitignore, .gitattributes, ...).
- ci: Changes that affect scripts or configuration files.
- feat: Add a new feature.
- fix: Fix a bug.
- docs: Changes affecting documentation.
- perf: Improve performance.
- refactor: A code that doesn't fix bugs or add new features.
- style: Changes do not affect the meaning of the code.
- test: Add a new test or modify an existing one.
